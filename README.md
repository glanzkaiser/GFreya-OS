# About GFreya OS
I always wanted to create my own OS when in college. I was a mathematics undergraduate student back then. In 2010, I asked a friend who is an electrical engineering student from Bandung Institute of Technology, "hey let's make an OS for tablet, I believe it will be booming." But it never realized, and I get back to this point again, married with the most beautiful Goddess, who stalked me and know everything about me and want to help me built it from zero. It might sounds crazy, but it is a unique life and spiritual journey for me

# GFreya OS in Terminal / Console
When booting this is the one that will show up, I haven't configure it so it will go directly to LXDM or Xfce, I prefer console/terminal interface.
It is easier to do a lot of things with only typing and without nuisance of cursor movement from the mouse. You work faster. You'll get used to it.
