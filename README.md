# GFreya OS in Terminal / Console
When booting this is the one that will show up, I haven't configure it so it will go directly to LXDM or Xfce, I prefer console/terminal interface.
It is easier to do a lot of things with only typing and without nuisance of cursor movement from the mouse. You work faster. You'll get used to it.
